# Word Guessing Game (Hangman)

A simple Python-based word guessing game (like Hangman) where the player guesses letters to figure out a random word.

## Features:
- The game randomly selects a word from a list.
- Player guesses one character at a time.
- If the guess is correct, the character is revealed in the word.
- If the guess is wrong, the player is prompted to try again.
- The game ends once the player guesses the full word.

## How to Play:
1. The game displays underscores (`_`) for each character in the word.
2. The player inputs one character at a time.
3. If the guess is correct, the corresponding underscore is replaced by the guessed letter.
4. If the guess is wrong, the player is encouraged to try again.
5. The game continues until the full word is guessed.

- Python 3.x or higher.
